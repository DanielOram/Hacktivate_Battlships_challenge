This is the repo for the team Torpedobear in the Hacktivate Battleships challenge held on 25/7/15 at Spark Lab - Level 4, Seafarers Building, Britomart, Auckland .
Team Torpedobear consisting of Daniel Oram, Connor Mattson and Naga Raju Srirangam.
I have refined the code past that of the state it was in when the competition was completed. Please refer to commit history to see my changes.

In order to run the game, locate the Battleships.py file and run it with the following cmd line args 

--play bot1 bot2 BLUE RED

where bot1 and bot2 stands for anyone of the 5 template bots or TorpedoBot - Torpedobear's battleship bot. 

The algorithm follows the hunt and target strategy and there are many improvements that can be made. I will come back to this project at some point if I have time.
